### jsonpath extension

The jsonpath extension implements [Stefan Goessner's JSONPath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
It provides functions for search and "search and replace" using JSONPath expressions:

[json_query](json_query.md)

[json_replace](json_replace.md)
    
### Stefan Goessner's JSONPath

[JSONPath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/), a loosely standardized syntax for querying JSON, is a creation of Stefan Goessner. 
JSONPath expressions refer to a JSON text in the same way as XPath expressions refer to an XML document. 

The [Jayway JSONPath Evaluator](https://jsonpath.herokuapp.com/) and [JSONPATH Expression Tester](https://jsonpath.curiousconcept.com/)
are good online evaluators for checking JSONPath expressions.

### jsoncons JSONPath

The jsoncons implementation follows these [ABNF rules](jsoncons-jsonpath-abnf.md).

#### Differences with Stefan Goessner's implementation

- Stefan Goessner's implemention returns `false` in case of no match, but in a note he suggests an alternative is to return an empty array. 
  The `jsoncons` implementation takes that alternative and returns an empty array in case of no match.
- Names in both the dot notation and the bracket notation may be unquoted (no spaces), single-quoted, or double-quoted.
- Wildcards are allowed in the dot notation
- Unions produce real unions with no duplicates instead of concatenated results
- Union of completely separate paths are allowed, e.g.

    $..[firstName,address.city]

#### Paths

JSONPath uses paths to select a set of nodes in a JSON value. Paths can use the dot-notation or the bracket-notation.

Select the first (indexed 0) book using the dot notation:

    $.store.book.0

or

    $. store . book . 0 

or

    store.book.0

or

    $.'store'.'book'.0

or

    $."store"."book".0

The leading `$` represents the root JSON value. The jsoncons implementation
allows the `$.` to be omitted, and allows single and double quoted as well as
unquoted names. Unquoted names must not contain spaces, and spaces before
and after the name are ignored. 

Select the first (indexed 0) book using the bracket-notation: 

    $[store][book][0]

or 

    $['store']['book'][0]

or

    $["store"]["book"][0]

Recursively select all book titles under `'$.store'`:

    $.'store'..'title'

Union of a subset of books identified by index:

    $.store[book[0],book[1],book[3]]

Union of the fourth book and all books with price > 10:

    $.store[book[3],book[?(@.price > 10)]]

JSONPath|       Description
--------|--------------------------------
`$`|    Represents the root JSON value
`@`|    Represents the current node being processed by a filter predicate.
`.` or `[]`|    Child operator
`..`    |Recursive descent. JSONPath borrows this syntax from [E4X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript_for_XML).
`*` |   Wildcard. All objects/elements regardless their names.
`[]`    |Subscript operator. 
`[,]`   |Union.
`[start:end:step]`      |Array slice operator borrowed from [ES4](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=proposals:slice_syntax&s=array+slice).
`()`    |Filter expression.
`?()`   |Applies a filter expression.

#### Filter predicates

JSONPath uses filter predicates to restrict the set of nodes returned by a path.

[Stefan Goessner's JSONPath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) does not provide any specification for the allowable filter expressions, simply stating that expressions can be anything that the underlying script engine can handle. `jsoncons` expressions support the following comparision and arithmetic operators. 

Operator|       Description
--------|--------------------------------
`*`     |Left times right
`/`     |Left divided by right
`+`     |Left plus right
`-`     |Left minus right
`&&`    |Left and right
<code>&#124;&#124;</code>    |Left or right
`==`    |Left is equal to right 
`!=`    |Left is not equal to right
`<`     |Left is less than right
`<=`    |Left is less or equal to right
`>`     |Left is greater than right
`>=`    |Left is greater than or equal to right
'=~'    |Left matches regular expression [?(@.author =~ /Evelyn.*?/)]

Unary operators

Operator|       Description
--------|--------------------------------
`!`     |Not right
`-`     |Negates right

Operator precedence

Precedence|Operator|Associativity
----------|--------|-----------
1 |`!` unary `-`    |Right
2 |`=~`             |Left
3 |`*` `/`          |Left 
4 |`+` `-`          |Left 
5 |`<` `>` `<=` `>=`|Left 
6 |`==` `!=`        |Left 
7 |`&&`             |Left 
8 |<code>&#124;&#124;</code> |Left 

#### Functions

Support for functions is a jsoncons extension.

Functions can be passed JSONPath paths and JSON expressions. 
Outside a filter predicate, functions can be passed paths that select from
the root JSON value `$`. Within a filter predicate, functions can be passed either a 
path that selects from the root JSON value `$`, or a path that selects from the current node `@`.

Function|Description|Result|Example
----------|--------|-------|---
`max(array)`|Returns the maximum value of an array of numbers|`double`|`max($.store.book[*].price)`
`min(array)`|Returns the minimum value of an array of numbers|`double`|`min($.store.book[*].price)`
`count(array)`|Returns the number of items in an array|`uint64_t`|`count($.store.book[*])`
`sum(array)`|Returns the sum value of an array of numbers|`double`|`$.store.book[?(@.price > sum($.store.book[*].price) / count($.store.book[*]))].title`
`avg(array)`|Returns the arithmetic average of each item of an array of numbers. If the input is an empty array, returns `null`.|`double`|`$.store.book[?(@.price > avg($.store.book[*].price))].title`
`prod(array)`|Returns the product of the elements in an array of numbers.|`double`|`$.store.book[?(479373 < prod($..price) && prod($..price) < 479374)].title`
`keys(object)`|Returns an array of keys.|`array of string`|`keys($.store.book[0])[*]`
`tokenize(string,pattern)`|Returns an array of strings formed by splitting the input string into an array of strings, separated by substrings that match the regular expression `pattern`.|`array of string`|`$.store.book[?(tokenize(@.author,'\\s+')[1] == 'Waugh')].title`
